# FlProg Library

This is a FLProg library with auto-selection and configuration for a connected controller (Arduino, ESP, STM, ANON). An additional advantage is the automatic detection of the loading environment of the finished program.
The library is optimized to minimize delays when executing the program on the controller, which allows you to avoid controller freezes.

The library has many blocks for working with various sensors, matrices and other devices. There are also blocks for working with data that have many settings for specific user tasks.

RT_00_HW_BASE_v.*** file for Arduino

EIS.01.SYSTEM ver.*** file for FlProg

_Unfortunately, at the moment the blocks are only available in Russian, but work is underway on other translation._
