# FlProg-Library
**FLProg Library for Arduino and other controllers**

This is a FLProg library with auto-selection and configuration for a connected controller (Arduino, ESP, STM, CANON). An additional advantage is the automatic detection of the loading environment of the finished program.
The library is optimized to minimize delays when executing the program on the controller, which allows you to avoid controller freezes.
